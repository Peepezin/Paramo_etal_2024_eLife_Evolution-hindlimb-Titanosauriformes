![sauropoda](https://www.dinosaurhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sauropoda.jpg)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "Paramo_etal_2024_eLife_Evolution-hindlimb-Titanosauriformes"! This repository contains supplementary material, data, and code related to the reviewed preprint titled "Evolution of hind limb morphology of Titanosauriformes (Sauropoda) analyzed via 3D GeoMorpho, revealing wide-gauge posture as an exaptation for gigantism" published in eLife, volume 13, by PÃ¡ramo, A., Mocho, P., Escaso, F., & Ortega, F. 

## Repository Summary
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of hind limb morphology in Titanosauriformes, a group of Sauropoda dinosaurs, using advanced 3D reconstruction and geometric morphometrics techniques. The study sheds light on how a wide-gauge posture in these dinosaurs may have served as an exaptation for gigantism.
